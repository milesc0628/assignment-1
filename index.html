    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Backstory:</h3>
    <p>Lestat de Lioncourt was born in France on November 7th, 1760. He was 34 when he was turned into a vampire by his maker Magnus, who had kidnapped him. After turning him, Magnus set himself on fire. Lestat left to perform in Paris, where he had a lover named Nicolas, <strong>for whom he would create music.</strong> Eventually, Nicolas was turned by another vampire, Armand, who Lestat also had a fling with. Nicolas was driven mad by his newfound vampirism and died. Lestat continues his fling with Armand but soon leaves Paris and travels to New Orleans, where he meets his most recent lover, Louis de Pointe du Lac.</p>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Relationship with Louis and the Aftermath:</h3>
    <p>Lestat sees Louis and is enamored by him immediately. He believes Louis to be similar to him, which starts his attraction. He intentionally courts Louis up until Louis stops talking to him due to the passing of his brother. Lestat speaks to Louis in his mind to come to him, and Louis, who is riddled with religious guilt, instead goes to a church. He confesses his sins to a priest, believing himself to be wrong for his attraction to Lestat, amongst other things. Lestat kills the priest and offers for Louis to become a vampire with him in exchange for Louis taking his own life. Louis accepts, and from there they have a relationship. They have a daughter together (turning a 14-year-old named Claudia into a vampire). Lestat and Louis have issues in this relationship, and Lestat and Claudia also stop getting along due to Lestat hating how Louis focuses only on her. Eventually, Lestat is "killed" by Louis and Claudia. Claudia insists on burning his body to ensure his death, but Louis refuses, as he is still in love with Lestat and secretly wants him to return.</p>
    <p>They both leave for Paris, and Lestat eventually follows. Louis and Claudia are tricked by a coven of vampires who then put them on trial. This coven is led by Armand! He has Lestat come as a witness to attest to them committing vampiric crimes. Even though he defends them, they are still tried. Claudia dies by sunlight. Lestat uses his mind powers to have the jury say for Louis to be banished rather than killed, ultimately saving Louis' life. When Louis escapes from banishment, he kills everyone in the coven except for Armand, who he believed was also a victim in the situation (due to them having been in a relationship since Louis got to Paris and Armand lying about his involvement). Louis leaves Paris with Armand, his last conversation with Lestat being negative, due to him not knowing Lestat had also been abused by the coven and forced to testify. Around 80 years later, Louis learns the truth during an interview hosted by Daniel Molloy, leading to him leaving Armand and reuniting with Lestat to apologize. They both apologize and mourn the loss of Claudia together. It is in this scene where it is revealed that Lestat is <strong>going on a tour,</strong> showcasing his music career.</p>

    <h2>Section 3</h2>
    <h3>Lestat's Discography:</h3>
    <p>Lestat has evolved in his genre of music performance. In the 1910's, we see many instances of him performing the piano and singing. He has great interest in music, and even gets personally offended if people perform notes incorrectly, to the point that he had tortured an opera singer and drained him of his blodo for being off-key. Although we haven't seen his full discography, which will most likely be revealed in season 3, we have heard some of his music, both from the show and from a teaser for season 3.</p>
    <p>Here are his songs listed in order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Come to Me</i>. <br>Recorded in 1937. Written by Lestat and performed by his affair partner, Antoinette. Lestat wrote the song for Louis and had Antoinette be the vocals, so that Louis would return to him after years of ignoring him.</li>
        <li><i>Come to Me</i>. <br>Re-recorded sometime after 1937 and before or during 1940. Written and performed by Lestat. A version with his vocals, to make the song more loving for Louis rather than petty. </li>
        <li><i>Long Face</i>. <br>Recorded potentially in 2022, it is unsure how many years may have passed from the end of season 2 to the beginning of season 3. Written and performed by Lestat. Many of the lyrics seem to be about Louis, with flirtatious subtext. It showcases the change in his music from classical to rock, the style change evident in the lyrics, his vocals, and the instrumentals.</li>
